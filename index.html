      <h2>My Why</h2>
      <p>
        Coding wasn't something I was always attracted to, it only came to my attention once I started working in a tech company and felt way out of my league.  I had thought of doing a coding bootcamp earlier but it never
        seemed like it was the right time.  There was too much going on at our startup to justify the away and as I was always on the road it was not possible to attend in person.
        So, once covid-19 hit and the world came to a halt, it was now or never!  I started with codecademy, on my own, to see if I could get the hang of things, see if it was something I could actually, turns out, I was!
        With my excitement at an all time high I started to once again look at the bootcamps available in town and who would have a class starting soon.  After some research and talking to my teammates
        they all agreed that the curriculum at Le Wagon would be a great start so without hesitation I applied!

      <h2>My Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        Take a sabbatical from work, code during the day and enjoy my evenings and come out of this nine weeks later feeling like I've accomplished something amazing and feel empowered.
        I knew I would have some difficulties because of my ADHD and lack of concentration but I have a therapist and we've worked on ways to manage these, so should be fine.
        Even before the first day of class there's about 60+ hrs of prep work so things should be breezy!
        We learned all the concepts and now we are just going to reinforce what we've learned, right!?
      </p>

      <h2>The Reality ðŸ˜‚ </h2>
      <p>
        God forgive my naivety, I was so wrong.  I did not expect to be mentally exhausted <strong>every. single. day.</strong>
        When I saw exhausted, I mean in bed by 9 pm latest, some days its 7:30 pm, no joke. I am usually a very neat person but this little naive child in front of you
        has dishes piled up, laundry to fold and floors to clean cause the exhaustion in the first 4 weeks is real folks. Here we are starting week 5 and starting front end and thank you Jesus cause
        I was about to throw in the towel. I could no longer have new information thrown at me I needed a break! Front end feels like a fresh breeze of a hot day, it revives and regenerates you, something that was and
        is after 4 weeks of questioning yourself about why I decided to do something like this at 32 years old after been out of school for a very longtime.
        After 4 weeks of emotional roller coaster rides, I can happily say that I regret nothing and I am so proud of myself and where I am today in my coding journey.
        I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the amazing staff at Le Wagon, my wonderful classmates, some of whom I will gladly call them a friend.
        The journey is not done just yet but looking back at what I've accomplished I know that whatever gets thrown at me, I can push through it.
